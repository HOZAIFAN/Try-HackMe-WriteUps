## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains detailed writeups of TryHackMe rooms I've completed. Each writeup includes the full attack methodology, tools used, and lessons learned. The goal is to document my learning process and create a reference for future penetration testing engagements.

### What You'll Find Here

These writeups serve as proof of my hands-on experience in:
- Network reconnaissance and enumeration
- Active Directory exploitation
- Privilege escalation techniques
- Post-exploitation and lateral movement

---

## 🎯 Completed Rooms

This section reflects all TryHackMe rooms I've successfully completed with detailed writeups and proof of exploitation.

### Categories

- **Active Directory** - Domain exploitation and privilege escalation
- **Web Exploitation** - Application security testing
- **Linux Privilege Escalation** - Path to root access
- **Windows Exploitation** - System compromise techniques

---

## 🛠️ Common Tools

Throughout these writeups, you'll see me using:

### Reconnaissance & Enumeration
- **Nmap** - Port scanning and service enumeration
- **NetExec (nxc)** - SMB/LDAP enumeration and exploitation

### Exploitation & Post-Exploitation
- **Impacket** - Windows protocol implementation toolkit
- **Hashcat** - Password hash cracking
- **Custom Scripts** - Automation when needed
