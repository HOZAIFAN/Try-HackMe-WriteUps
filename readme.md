📌 About This Repository
This repository contains detailed writeups of TryHackMe rooms I've completed. Each writeup includes the full attack methodology, tools used, and lessons learned. The goal is to document my learning process and create a reference for future penetration testing engagements.
These writeups serve as proof of my hands-on experience in:

Network reconnaissance and enumeration
Active Directory exploitation
Privilege escalation techniques
Post-exploitation and lateral movement

🎯 Completed Rooms
This section reflects all TryHackMe rooms I've successfully completed with detailed writeups and proof of exploitation.
🛠️ Common Tools
Throughout these writeups, you'll see me using:

Nmap - Port scanning and service enumeration
NetExec (nxc) - SMB/LDAP enumeration and exploitation
Impacket - Windows protocol implementation toolkit
Hashcat - Password hash cracking
Custom Scripts - Automation when needed

📂 Repository Structure
Each room has its own folder containing:

⚠️ Legal Disclaimer
All activities documented in this repository were performed in authorized TryHackMe lab environments for educational purposes only.
Do not attempt these techniques on systems you don't own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal under various cybersecurity laws worldwide.
This repository is intended for:

Security students learning penetration testing
Professionals preparing for certifications (OSCP, eJPT, PNPT)
Recruiters evaluating technical skills

🎓 Learning Path
These writeups support my preparation for industry certifications and real-world penetration testing scenarios. The techniques documented here align with frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and OWASP testing methodologies.
